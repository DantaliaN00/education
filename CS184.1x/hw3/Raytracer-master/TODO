WHEN IMAGE DIMENSIONS ARENT EQUAL

Notes

S (lightColor*specularMaterial*refl_ray) = basically reuse the specular parameter

Transformations -let's consider a sphere in object space
-we transform it into world space with M

M^-1 * ray gets the ray, and we get a t ultimately. then we use that t in the 
untransformed ray

normals: how do we convert normals back into worldspace?
M-interves-transpose * normal to get to object space
inverse, then transpose

pixel-perfect doesn't matter



Stuff for Hw6:

-make emissive surfaces work like light sources

-make emissive surfaces GLOW

-add quads

-actually do acceleration structures

-parallelize!

-interactivity! add the functionality to click on some pixel in the rendered image, and shoot a ray from that
to some geometry object - also add the ability to add new geometry objects


-edge detection plus antialiasing with http://www.hackification.com/2008/08/31/experiments-in-ray-tracing-part-8-anti-aliasing/
