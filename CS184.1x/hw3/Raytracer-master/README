NOTE: the full writup is on the website.

Our raytracer currently correctly generates rays for perspective view,
and renders shapes with Blinn-Phong Shading, reflections and shadows
as described in the assignment specification. Use make to build the 
raytracer. A sample of how to run it is "./raytracer -r test1.scenefile"

The command line flags -a -b -c and -e disable specular, diffuse,
emissive and ambient terms, respectively. Any or all of these flags
may be combined.

For triangles and trinorms, we apply transformations when the shape is
defined rather than when the verticies comprising it are defined.

Reflection is disabled by default; pass the -r flag into the
program to enable reflection. Reflections by and on both spheres
and triangles is supported.

Shadowing is supported, again on both spheres and triangles

There is no acceleration structure. Everything else is implemented.


Additional Features:

-we have implemented a new keyword bkgcolor r g b,
which sets the color of a ray that does not hit
any objects to whatever color is specified
