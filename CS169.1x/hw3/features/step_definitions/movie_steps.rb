Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|

    # you should arrange to add that movie to the database here.
    Movie.create!(movie)
  end

end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.body is the entire content of the page as a string.
  #flunk "Unimplemented"
  page.body.index(e1).should < page.body.index(e2)
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  # HINT: use String#split to split up the rating_list, then
  #   iterate over the ratings and reuse the "When I check..." or
  #   "When I uncheck..." steps in lines 89-95 of web_steps.rb
